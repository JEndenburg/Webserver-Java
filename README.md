Webserver-Java
===
Implementation of the "webserver" exercise at the Sogyo BV academy.
The intention here was to create a simple webserver in Java that processes requests and sends appropriate responses. The end result is slightly less simple since it ended up getting its own processing language (Assembled HTML) as well as a properties file for configuration.
